        <p class="title">Types of cancer</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Skin cancer: </b>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer.
            The main types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, basal
            cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Melanoma is much less common than the
            other types but much more likely to invade nearby tissue and spread
            to other parts of the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Breast cancer: </b>Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the
            cells of the breasts. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most
            common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer
            can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Prostate cancer: </b>Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the
            prostate. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland in males that
            produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.
            Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pancreatic cancer: </b>Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that
            begins as a growth of cells in the pancreas. The pancreas lies
            behind the lower part of the stomach. It makes enzymes that help
            digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar. The most
            common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal
            adenocarcinoma.
